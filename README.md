# Quote-of-the-day
I'm happy to share the completion of my  task 
Hello everyone!
 I recently completed my  assigned task: building a "Quote of the Day" Android application. This project involved designing a clean and intuitive user interface with a soft color palette, integrating with a free quote API to fetch daily inspiration.
This experience has been incredibly rewarding. It allowed me to apply my Kotlin and Android development skills in a practical setting and learn so much about the end-to-end app development process.
Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
